  findByDistrict,
  findByPin,
} from "cowin-api-client";

const start = async () => {
  // Getting All the states
  const states = await getStates();

  // Getting all the districts of that state.
  const districts = await getDistricts(states.states[0].state_id);

  // Getting appoinments by Pincode
  const appoinmentsByPin = await findByPin(403601, "03-05-2021");

  // Getting appoinments by Districts
  const appoinmentsByDistrict = await findByDistrict(
